        ### What You Need to Do:
        1. **Purchase** words / word combinations / story content to create stories
        2. **Create** a science fiction short story based on whar you purchased
        3. **Submit** your work, set copyright transfer fees and submit
        
        ### After You Submit:
        1. Your work will be scored by an independent jury based on the overall impression
        2. The word combination you used and your work's score will be displayed in the "Story Square" for the next round of participants
        3. Next round participants can purchase your word combination at word prices, or buy your complete work at your set copyright transfer fee
        4. If your work / word combination are purchased, you will receive additional compensation; otherwise you will only receive the base compensation

        ### Important Rules:
         - When creating, ensure each sentence contains exactly one of your chosen words (one word per sentence)
         - A word can only be used once
         - Please do not close the browser or skip questions during the experiment
         - If you encounter technical issues, please refresh the page to restart
         - You can withdraw from the study at any time without penalty
